# EX 14 : C PROGRAM TO DELETE FIRST ELEMENT IN AN ARRAY
## AIM:
To write a C program to delete first element in an array.

## Algorithm
1.	Start.
2.	Define a variables i,j,a.
3.	Read the value using scanf.
4.	Ask the user to make an input
5.	Print out the answer
6.	End.


## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h>
 int main()
{
int i,n,a[10];
scanf("%d",&n);
 for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
scanf("%d",&a[i]);

}
for(i=1;i<n;i++)
 printf("%d ",a[i]);
